## Introduction

Image recognition refers to technologies that identify places, logos, people, objects, buildings, and several other variables in images. Users are sharing vast amounts of data through apps, social networks, and websites. Additionally, mobile phones equipped with cameras are leading to the creation of limitless digital images and videos. The large volume of digital data is being used by companies to deliver better and smarter services to the people accessing it.

Image recognition is a part of computer vision and a process to identify and detect an object or attribute in a digital video or image. Computer vision is a broader term which includes methods of gathering, processing and analyzing data from the real world. The data is high-dimensional and produces numerical or symbolic information in the form of decisions. Apart from image recognition, computer vision also includes event detection, object recognition, learning, image reconstruction and video tracking.

Building a full stack application involves setting up a database along with working on the client and server-side development. This project aims at building a full stack web application that identifies the breed of dogs from pictures. The application also stores all the images previously uploaded by the user and stores its associated labels along with the probability score into the database. This project deals with efficiently storing the images on the cloud and performing image recognition of images and processing the results to store into a database. It also deals with graphical representation of the probability score of the results obtained from image recognition.
